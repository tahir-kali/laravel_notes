Laravel Route Constraints 

Global Constraints
If you would like a route parameter to always be constrained by a given regular expression, you may use the pattern method. You should define these patterns in the boot method of your App\Providers\RouteServiceProvider class:

/**
 * Define your route model bindings, pattern filters, etc.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    Route::pattern('id', '[0-9]+');
}


Customizing The Key
Sometimes you may wish to resolve Eloquent models using a column other than id. To do so, you may specify the column in the route parameter definition:

use App\Models\Post;
 
Route::get('/posts/{post:slug}', function (Post $post) {
    return $post;
});

If you would like model binding to always use a database column other than id when retrieving a given model class, you may override the getRouteKeyName method on the Eloquent model:

/**
 * Get the route key for the model.
 */
public function getRouteKeyName(): string
{
    return 'slug';
}
