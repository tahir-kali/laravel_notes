All routes and controllers should return a response to be sent back to the user's browser. Laravel provides several different ways to return responses. The most basic response is returning a string from a route or controller. The framework will automatically convert the string into a full HTTP response:

Route::get('/', function () {
    return 'Hello World';
});

If you are redirecting to a route with an "ID" parameter that is being populated from an Eloquent model, you may pass the model itself. The ID will be extracted automatically:

// For a route with the following URI: /profile/{id}
 
return redirect()->route('profile', [$user]);
