Instead of defining all of your request handling logic as closures in your route files, you may wish to organize this behavior using "controller" classes. Controllers can group related request handling logic into a single class. For example, a UserController class might handle all incoming requests related to users, including showing, creating, updating, and deleting users. By default, controllers are stored in the app/Http/Controllers directory.

Sometimes, your application will have resources that may only have a single instance. For example, a user's "profile" can be edited or updated, but a user may not have more than one "profile". Likewise, an image may have a single "thumbnail". These resources are called "singleton resources", meaning one and only one instance of the resource may exist. In these scenarios, you may register a "singleton" resource controller:


use App\Http\Controllers\ProfileController;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
 
Route::singleton('profile', ProfileController::class);

Route::singleton('photos.thumbnail', ThumbnailController::class)->creatable();

Route::singleton(...)->destroyable();
